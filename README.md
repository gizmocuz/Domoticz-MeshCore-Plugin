![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)  
🔗 _MeshCore LoRa Mesh integration for Domoticz Home Automation_

This plugin connects your **[MeshCore LoRa mesh nodes](https://meshcore.co.uk/)** to [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/), exposing node telemetry, message inbox, and send controls as native Domoticz devices — ready for automations, dashboards and scripting.

> 📻 Track battery, signal quality and uptime of your connected node · 📨 Send & receive LoRa messages · 🖥️ Custom real-time dashboard included!

----------

## ✨ Features

- **Auto-discovery** – All contacts advertised by the mesh are automatically discovered and tracked
- **Self-node Telemetry** – Battery, voltage, RSSI, SNR, noise floor, uptime, airtime and packet counters for the connected node
- **Remote Node Status** – Online/offline detection, SNR, hops and last-seen timestamp for every discovered contact
- **Online / Offline Detection** – Automatic status based on last advertisement age (8 h threshold) or path availability
- **Message Inbox** – Every received LoRa message appears in Domoticz with sender, channel and timestamp
- **Send Messages** – Send direct or channel messages straight from Domoticz or the dashboard
- **Reply Support** – Reply to any message directly from the dashboard inbox
- **Custom Dashboard** – Built-in real-time dark-mode dashboard with node cards, message history, filters and compose bar

## ⚙️ Installation

> ✅ Domoticz with Python plugin support & Python 3.6+ required

### Prerequisites

- Domoticz installed and running
  - **Minimum version: build `17956` (`2025.2.17956`, 2026-05-16) or newer.** The custom dashboard uses the plugin↔frontend WebSocket channel (`Domoticz.WebSocketSend` / `onWebSocketMessage`), which was added in that build. Older Domoticz versions can run the plugin's devices but not the real-time dashboard.
- A [MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk/) node reachable over TCP (companion app or radio bridge)
  - Alternative firmware: [MeshcoMod](https://www.meshcomod.com) — a MeshCore-compatible fork for Heltec v3 / v4 boards that adds native WiFi, so the node can expose its TCP companion port directly without a USB bridge.

### Setup

```sh
cd ~/domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/galadril/Domoticz-MeshCore-Plugin.git MeshCore
cd MeshCore
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo service domoticz.sh restart
```

Then go to **Setup → Hardware** and add a new hardware entry of type **MeshCore**.

#### Docker / Docker Compose

The plugin still needs the `meshcore` Python package installed inside the container. Clone the plugin into your mounted plugins folder as above, then edit `customstart.sh` (the Domoticz container's customisation hook) and add:

```sh
pip3 install meshcore
```

This runs on every container start, so the package survives image rebuilds. On Debian-12-based images you may need `pip3 install --break-system-packages meshcore`.

----------

## 🛠 Configuration

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Transport** | TCP or Serial |
| **MeshCore Host** | (TCP) IP address of the MeshCore TCP endpoint |
| **MeshCore Port** | (TCP) TCP port (default `5000`) |
| **Serial Port** | (Serial) COM/tty port — dropdown auto-populated by Domoticz with detected adapters |
| **Baud Rate** | (Serial) default `115200` |
| **Install Custom Dashboard** | Yes / No — installs `meshcore.html` into Domoticz templates (default Yes) |
| **Debug Level** | None / Basic / All |

If a serial connection drops (cable unplugged, device reset), the plugin logs an error and automatically retries every 30 s. A “Connected” log line is emitted once the link is restored.

> All contacts discovered by the mesh are tracked automatically — there is no manual node list to configure.

----------

## 🧾 Devices Created

Devices are created automatically on first data received for each node.

### Global devices

| Device | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Mesh Inbox** | Text | Last received message — format `[C0\|sender] text` or `[P\|sender] text` |
| **Mesh Send** | Text | Write here to send a message (see below) |
| **Mesh Msgs Received** | Custom (msgs) | Running counter of messages received since plugin start |
| **Mesh Msgs Sent** | Custom (msgs) | Running counter of messages successfully sent since plugin start |

### Self (connected) node — units 10–29

| Device | Type |
|---|---|
| Status | Switch (always On when connected) |
| Battery | Percentage |
| Battery V | Custom (V) |
| RSSI | Custom (dBm) |
| SNR | Custom (dB) |
| Noise Floor | Custom (dBm) |
| Last Seen | Text |
| Uptime | Custom (min) |
| Airtime TX | Custom (s) |
| Pkts Sent | Custom (pkts) |
| Pkts Recv | Custom (pkts) |

### Remote (discovered) nodes — units 30+

Each discovered contact gets a minimal device set:

| Device | Type |
|---|---|
| Status | Switch (online / offline) |
| SNR | Custom (dB) |
| Last Seen | Text |
| Hops | Custom (hops) — path length to reach the node |

> Additional devices (battery, RSSI, noise floor, uptime, airtime, packet counters) are created for remote nodes when a STATUS_RESPONSE push event is received — requires supported firmware on the remote node.

----------

## 📨 Sending Messages

Write to the **Mesh Send** device via the Domoticz API, a script, or the custom dashboard.

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `hello world` | Direct message to the first discovered contact |
| `garden: hello` | Direct message to the node named `garden` |
| `#General: hello` | Broadcast on the channel named `General` |
| `#0: hello` | Broadcast on channel index 0 |
| `#flood: hello` | Broadcast on channel 0 (alias) |

> **Tip:** Channel names are resolved automatically by the plugin — you don't need to look up numeric indices. Available channels are logged on startup (e.g. `MeshCore channels: #0 = General, #1 = MyRoom`).

### Internal control commands

The **Mesh Send** device also accepts `!`-prefixed commands that configure the
device or plugin state instead of transmitting a message. They never appear in
the inbox or count towards the sent-messages counter. Useful for scripting.

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `!remove <name>` | Remove the named contact from the connected device |
| `!favorite add <name>` | Mark `<name>` as a favorite (sorted first on the dashboard, persisted to `meshcore_favorites.json`) |
| `!favorite remove <name>` | Drop favorite |
| `!manual_add on` / `!manual_add off` | Enable/disable manual-add-contacts on the device (off = auto-add adverts) |
| `!set telemetry_base <0\|1\|2>` | Off / Public / Always |
| `!set telemetry_env <0\|1\|2>` | Same, for environmental telemetry |
| `!set telemetry_loc <0\|1\|2>` | Same, for location telemetry |
| `!set adv_loc_policy <0\|1>` | Never share / Share location in adverts |
| `!flood_scope <#tag>` | Set the device's default flood scope (empty = global flood, e.g. `!flood_scope #nl`) |

`!favorite` is handled entirely in the plugin — no MC session is opened.
The other `!` commands open a short radio session to apply the change.

----------

## 📜 dzVents Example Scripts

Two ready-to-use **dzVents demo scripts** are included in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder. Copy either (or both) to `~/domoticz/scripts/dzVents/generated_scripts/`, edit the `CONFIGURATION` block at the top to match your device names, channel name and node name, and enable it.

### 📊 Status Report — periodic home updates

Sends **readable themed messages** (Climate, Weather, Energy) one per minute on the hour, plus **instant alerts** on presence changes — perfect for keeping an eye on your house via LoRa.

**Example output on the mesh:**
```
Climate: Indoor 20.3C, 52% | Thermostat 19.5C
Weather: 14.8C, 65%
Energy: Solar 1240W | Delivery 380W | Gas today 0.42 m3
```

➡️ **[Download the status report script](docs/meshcore_status_report.lua)**

### 💬 Chat Responder — interactive command bot

Turns your Domoticz into an **interactive chat bot** on your MeshCore channel. Send a command from any LoRa device and receive live status information back.

Commands must start with a **prefix character** (default: `!`) so the bot only reacts to explicit requests and never responds to its own messages. The prefix is configurable via `CMD_PREFIX` in the script.

The script filters on the channel name (matching `CHANNEL_NAME`) and queues multi-part replies one per minute to avoid LoRa TX overlap.

**Supported commands** (case-insensitive):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!help` | List available commands |
| `!status` | Full summary (climate, weather, energy, house) |
| `!climate` / `!klimaat` | Indoor climate + heating status |
| `!weather` / `!weer` | Outdoor weather conditions |
| `!energy` / `!energie` | Power, solar, battery, gas |
| `!home` / `!huis` | Water usage, presence |
| `!device <name>` / `!apparaat <naam>` | Query any Domoticz device by name |
| `!switches` / `!schakelaars` | List all switches and their states |
| `!temp` | All temperature sensors |

**Example conversation on the mesh:**
```
[You]  → !climate
[Bot]  → Climate: Indoor 20.3C, 52% | Thermostat 19.5C | Heat pump: Heating
[You]  → !device Power
[Bot]  → Power: 380W (updated: 2025-01-15 14:32:00)
```

## 📊 Custom Dashboard

Enable **Install Custom Dashboard** in the plugin settings, then navigate to:

```
Setup → More Options → Custom Pages → meshcore
```

> 🌐 **Live demo:** [galadril.github.io/Domoticz-MeshCore-Plugin](https://galadril.github.io/Domoticz-MeshCore-Plugin/#)

### Dashboard features

- **Node cards** — online/offline badge, battery bar, signal quality bars (SNR), hops, last seen — every value links to its Domoticz device log
- **Signal quality bars** — color-coded visual SNR indicator (green = excellent, yellow = fair, red = poor)
- **Uptime formatting** — human-readable display like "2d 5h 12m" instead of raw minutes
- **Node map** — click the 📍 icon on any contact card / list row to open a Leaflet map side-panel centered on that node (OpenStreetMap tiles loaded from `unpkg.com`; if your browser's tracking-prevention blocks the CDN, the panel shows a fallback message with the raw coordinates)
- **Manual node locations** — place a `meshcore_locations.json` in the plugin folder to pin nodes without GPS on the map (see below)
- **Message inbox** — backed by the SQLite message store; server-side pagination (infinite scroll for older messages) with timestamps, channel tags and sender names
- **Channel & search filters** — per-channel scope and search are resolved server-side within the selected scope (works across the full stored history, not just what's on screen)
- **DM conversations** — pin a contact to see its full direct-message thread (served from the store; both directions, with delivery-ACK markers)
- **Compose bar** — select a channel or direct target, type and send
- **Reply** — hover any message and click ↩ Reply to pre-fill the compose bar with the right target and channel
- **@mention highlighting** — `@name` tokens are highlighted in green in message text
- **Emoji picker** — full categorised emoji picker (700+ emoji, WhatsApp-style) with search
- **Mesh topology & path lines** — map view plots contacts and (optionally) heard nodes, and draws the real multi-hop repeater paths recent messages traversed
- **Live updates** — pushed in real time over the plugin↔frontend WebSocket channel

----------

## 🗺️ Manual Node Locations

If some of your nodes don’t broadcast GPS coordinates, you can manually pin them on the dashboard map.

Create a file called `meshcore_locations.json` in the plugin directory (`domoticz/plugins/MeshCore/`):

```json
{
    "Garden": {"lat": 52.3690, "lon": 4.9075},
    "Garage": {"lat": 52.3665, "lon": 4.9010}
}
```

- Node names must match the contact names exactly (case-sensitive)
- Live GPS data from nodes automatically overrides manual coordinates
- The file is loaded on plugin start and copied to the dashboard
- The map section only appears when at least one node has coordinates (from GPS or manual)

----------

## 🔄 Poll Intervals

| What | Interval |
|---|---|
| Contacts refresh (incremental) | every 30 s |
| Liveness probe (full contacts refresh) | every 5 min |
| Self-node stats (battery, RSSI, uptime, counters) | every 5 min |
| Stale connection detection | 10 min without push events triggers reconnect |

----------

## 🔁 Updating

```sh
cd ~/domoticz/plugins/MeshCore
git pull
sudo service domoticz.sh restart
```

> **⚠️ Breaking change — DomoticzEx migration**
>
> This release moves the plugin to the `DomoticzEx` framework so it is no
> longer limited to ~11 remote contacts (the old 255-unit-per-plugin cap).
> Devices are now keyed by a stable DeviceID (`self` for the connected node,
> the 12-char public-key prefix for each remote contact).
>
> After upgrading, your **old per-node devices become orphaned** — Domoticz
> does not auto-migrate them. Delete them once:
> *Setup → Devices*, filter by the MeshCore hardware, and remove the old
> entries. The plugin recreates fresh devices automatically on the next
> contact poll. No dashboard data is lost — `meshcore.html` re-reads its
> JSON map every tick and the historical RX log is preserved.

----------

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

Enable **Basic** or **All** debug logging in plugin settings for verbose logs in the Domoticz log viewer.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `meshcore package not installed` | Run `pip install meshcore` on the Domoticz machine, then restart |
| Connection errors | Verify host/port are reachable; check the MeshCore companion app is running |
| Node not appearing | The plugin auto-discovers all contacts — make sure the node is advertising on the mesh; check the log for discovered contact names |
| Battery / stats missing for remote nodes | Requires firmware support for STATUS_RESPONSE push events |
| Connection drops silently | The plugin detects stale connections after 10 min and reconnects; enable debug logging to diagnose |

----------

## 🕘 Changelog

| Version | Notes |
|---|---|
| Unreleased | WebSocket transport for the dashboard (no more JSON-file / JSON-API polling). SQLite message store (`meshcore_messages.db`) is now the single source of truth for the inbox **and** per-contact DM conversations, with server-side pagination + search and a schema-versioned `preferences` table for future migrations. Per-contact "Messages" DM devices retired (existing ones are left for the user to remove manually). Mesh topology now shows heard nodes (when enabled) and draws real multi-hop repeater path lines. Delivery-ACK annotation on sent DMs, heard-node hit counts + prune, per-channel message stats, and assorted dashboard fixes. |
| 0.0.1 | Initial release — telemetry, inbox, send, custom dashboard |
